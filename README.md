# Data generator with a control over linear separability

We propose a new data generator that is useful for a systematic benchmarking of algorithms for classification and clustering.

## Features
* A user can adjust:
  * how many pairs of classes must be linearly non-separable
  * the number of classes
  * the number of data-points inside a class
  * the probability distribution of data-points
  * the minimal distance between each pair of classes
  * the shape of a point-set that forms a class
* 38 different shapes of classes of various difficulty levels are available.
* The output is a two-dimensional dataset.
* It is easy to use generator in a batch mode by calling the function `createDataset()` with different parameters.

## Getting started
